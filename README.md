# Galaxsee 🚀

Welcome to **Galaxsee**, a cosmic social game built as a Devvit app for Reddit! Dive into a universe where you can explore distant galaxies, discover other space travelers, and send signals across the stars—all within your favorite Reddit community. Whether you're scanning nearby galaxies or exchanging messages with fellow explorers, Galaxsee brings the wonders of space to your fingertips.

## What is Galaxsee?

Galaxsee transforms your Reddit experience into an interactive space adventure. Each player gets a unique galaxy with random coordinates in a 2D universe. From there, you can:
- **Scan Space**: Discover other galaxies within a 200-unit radius of your position.
- **Send Signals**: Communicate with nearby explorers, with success based on distance—closer galaxies (under 100 units) guarantee delivery, while farther ones (100-200 units) have a 50% chance.
- **Check Your Inbox**: Receive messages from others and build connections across the cosmos.

Built with Devvit, Galaxsee leverages Reddit’s API for seamless user authentication and Redis for persistent storage of galaxies and signals. It’s a fun way to connect with others in a subreddit like `r/galaxsee_pnf_alpha` while exploring a playful, space-themed universe.

## Why Explore Galaxsee?

- 🌌 **Immersive Space Theme**: Feel like a cosmic explorer with a beautifully designed dark-themed UI.
- 🤝 **Social Interaction**: Engage with other Reddit users through spatial messaging mechanics.
- 🛠️ **Open to Contributions**: Whether you’re a developer or a space enthusiast, we’d love for you to help shape the universe of Galaxsee!
